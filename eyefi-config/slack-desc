# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

eyefi-config: Eye-Fi Configuration Tool
eyefi-config:
eyefi-config: This is an unofficial, open implementation of some of the tools 
eyefi-config: needed to manage an Eye-Fi card. It should run just about anywhere, 
eyefi-config: as long as you have wpa_supplicant around to help creating 
eyefi-config: the WPA keys. 
eyefi-config: Note that this does not replace the Eye-Fi-supplied manager for card 
eyefi-config: registration or changing online upload services, nor does it perform 
eyefi-config: as the "Upload to my computer" destination.
