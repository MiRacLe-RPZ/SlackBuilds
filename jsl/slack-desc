# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

jsl:
jsl: With JavaScript Lint, you can check all your JavaScript source code 
jsl: for common mistakes without actually running the script or opening 
jsl: the web page.
jsl: JavaScript Lint holds an advantage over competing lints because it is 
jsl: based on the JavaScript engine for the Firefox browser. This provides 
jsl: a robust framework that can not only check JavaScript syntax but also 
jsl: examine the coding techniques used in the script and warn against 
jsl: questionable practices.
